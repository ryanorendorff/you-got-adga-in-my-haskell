You got Agda in my Haskell!
===========================

One of your coworkers seems to write the most amazing Haskell code. It never
breaks and it always fits the requirements precisely. You’ve never seen your
coworker put in a bug fix for their code ever. One day you decide to ask them
how they obtained these inhuman powers. With a huge grin on their face, they say
“why that’s because I wrote all my provably correct code in Agda!”

In this talk, we will talk about a new tool called agda2hs which allows
programmers to translate dependently typed Agda code into clean Haskell code,
enabling the extraction of provably correct programs. We will look into specific
examples on how the code can be used to prove that a piece of code has some
desired specification.
